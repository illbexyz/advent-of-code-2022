# Advent of Code 2022

Solutions for Advent of Code 2022 in ðŸ¦€ **Rust**.

## Disclaimer

As a newbie rustacean I'm solving the Advent of Code puzzles as a mean to **learn the language**. My objective is not to solve the puzzles as quickly as possibile nor to solve them in the most performant way.
 
Instead, I will write the solutions trying to be as **idiomatic** and **maintainable** as possible. But being a newbie, they will likely suck anyway ðŸ˜Š
